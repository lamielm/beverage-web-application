The following Bootstrap examples should help you see some thing that you can do in your own site if desired. Since they are part of the Bootstrap documentation, it is okay (and encouraged) that you take code directly from it. Again, since this is part of the documentation, it is free from Plagiarism. Examples taken from anywhere else on the internet must be properly listed in the outside resources section.

I may not have had time to demonstrate checkboxes in the in-class material. Because of that, you may find some useful information in the following link that explains how to use them. More than likely you will want to use them for the `Active` field. Additionally, if you are stuck, don't hesitate to ask questions and have me look at your project.
